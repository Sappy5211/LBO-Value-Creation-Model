# Final Recommendation: Acquisition of "AquaServe UK"

**To:** Investment Committee  
**From:** Deal Team  
**Date:** 2025-09-14  
**Subject:** A Platform for Consolidation in UK Water Infrastructure Services

## 1) The Opportunity & Recommendation

We have a time‑sensitive opportunity to acquire **"AquaServe UK"** (the Company), a leading regional water services contractor, for **£43.3m (8.0× Y1 EBITDA)**.

This is a classic **good company at a fair price** in a non‑cyclical sector. The thesis is **self‑help**: back a strong operations team, professionalize the platform, and harvest **technology‑enabled margin expansion** and **route density**. Not a wager on market growth or multiple arbitrage.

**Recommendation:** **Proceed**. Underwriting delivers **2.34× MOIC / 23.7% IRR** (Base) and **1.75× / 15.0%** (Downside).

## 2) Why This Business? Why Now? (Commercial Character)

**Who we’re backing:** a 20‑year‑old, family‑owned operator known for high first‑time‑fix rates and dependable SLA delivery. The **Head of Operations** is the cultural cornerstone; we will add a sector CFO in **Day‑100** to professionalize control, pricing, and M&A integration.

**Why now:** the **AMP8** regulatory cycle compels five‑year leakage and efficiency spend that maps precisely to AquaServe’s core capabilities. The market is **fragmented**: small regionals with limited systems, and larger outsourcers that struggle with agility. This is the **window to scale** a tech‑enabled challenger and become the **acquirer of choice** for tuck‑ins.

---

## 3) Competitive Edge & Right to Win

- **Credibility & relationships:** multi‑year frameworks with multiple UK utilities; reputation for quality and low re‑work.
- **Operational moat:** route optimization + mobile workforce tools → engineer utilization up; leakage programs reduce truck rolls.  
- **Data & technology:** smart‑meter read automation; telemetry‑driven leak triage.  
- **M&A flywheel:** disciplined tuck‑ins in adjacent districts (target size **£5–10m revenue**) to deepen route density and reduce overhead per job.

**Competitive set (illustrative):** regional specialists and larger utility services groups. Our scaled, tech‑enabled footprint should command preference on renewals and mini‑competitions.

## 4) Plan to Create Value (and what we actually underwrite)

1) **People:** retain Head of Ops; hire sector **CFO (Day‑100)**; stand up PMO for savings.  
2) **Operations:** routing & scheduling software; leakage‑program playbook; energy‑intensity reduction.  
3) **Commercial:** tighten indexation pass‑through; bid discipline; land‑and‑expand on telemetry & data services.  
4) **M&A:** 2–3 tuck‑ins, fast integration, synergy tracking.

**Value bridge (Base):** Equity value is **EBITDA growth £25.9m** + **Deleveraging £9.5m**; **0** reliance on multiple expansion.

## 5) Capital Structure, Headroom & “So What”

- **Leverage:** LTM net leverage **~4.1× → ~2.3×** (hold period).  
- **Cover:** **ICR (LTM) ≥ ~3×** through plan.  
- **Sensitivities:** returns most exposed to **exit multiple** (±~550 bps IRR) and **margin delivery** (±~210 bps). Rates and capex are secondary at this leverage.

## 6) Risk, Directly Addressed

**Base structuring MC** shows **technical DSCR triggers** late in hold from capex/WC timing; leverage and ICR remain comfortable.

- **Term‑sheet solution:** **Springing DSCR post‑Y1**, mild **capex smoothing**, preserve **£12m RCF**.
- **Observed in data:** current lender‑case MC (with springing DSCR) still flags DSCR clustering; we treat this as a *documentation item* to be aligned with lenders, not a thesis flaw.  
- **Realistic term‑sheet variant (Leverage + ICR only):** **Any breach = 0.5%** across simulations; breaches are **ICR** only.  
  → Lender case summary (springing DSCR): [`tables/lender_case_monte_carlo_summary.csv`](tables/lender_case_monte_carlo_summary.csv)  
  → Term‑sheet variant (Lev+ICR only): [`tables/term_sheet_variant_lev_icr_only_summary.csv`](tables/term_sheet_variant_lev_icr_only_summary.csv)

**Bottom line:** debt is serviceable on cash; covenant language is the lever, not the business.

---

## 7) Exit Strategy (a buyer, not just “a buyer”)

By Year 5, AquaServe is a **scaled, tech‑enabled water services platform** with a clean integration story and route‑dense footprint. Logical acquirers include **UK utility services consolidators and environmental services strategics** (e.g., **Veolia**, **Mitie**, **M Group Services**) seeking leakage capability, telemetry, and regional density. That’s why **8.0–9.0×** exit is warranted in underwriting.

---

## 8) Decision & Next Steps

**Proceed to confirmatory diligence** focused on:  
- Engineer utilization & first‑time‑fix KPIs; SLA history & renewal probabilities.  
- Indexation mechanisms; energy‑intensity per job.  
- Capex phasing realism; tuck‑in pipeline validation; management references.

**Signing conditions:** maintain leverage step‑down grid; include **springing DSCR** and a **cash‑trap** if DSCR <1.1× post‑Y1.
